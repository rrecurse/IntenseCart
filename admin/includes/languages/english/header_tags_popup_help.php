    Header Tags come with a default set of tags. You can create your own
    set of tags for each page (it comes with some set up, like for index
    and product pages).

<pre>
HT = Header Tags  
T  = Title 
A  = All 
D  = Description
K  = Keywords
C  = Categories *
</pre>  
<b>* Note:</b> The HT+C+A is used only for the category and product pages. It
causes the category and / or product name to be displayed in the title if no
other category or product level Meta Tags have been specified.<br>
<br>

If HT+T+A are checked, then it says display the Header Tags Title All;  
(default title plus the one you set up). So if you have the option checked, both titles will be displayed.<br><br>


Let's say your title is Mysite and the default title is "Where you can find the best deals on all widgets!".<br>
<pre>
With HT+T+A on, the title is:<br>
 "Mysite - Where you can find the best deals on all widgets!"<br><br>
With HT+T+A off, the title is:<br>
 "Where you can find the best deals on all widgets!"
</pre>
</p>
To truly get a grasp on how the system produces tags with the different options,
set up a Category and Product level set of Meta Tags. Specify some default Tags
on the Meta Tags Text control. Then set different options (HT+T+A or HT+C+A etc).
Save settings and refresh your pages to view differently formatted Meta tags. Once satisfied,
we would suggest you retain these settings for as long as possible.
